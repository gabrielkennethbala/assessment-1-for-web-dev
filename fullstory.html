        <h1>Synapsis</h1>
    <p>Destiny 2 is a game which revoles around the traveler, a supergiant terraforming machine regarded as a deity by the majority 
        of the races it protects, giving superpowered abilities to chosen people called guardians. These guardians are given machines
        called "ghosts" that support their needs and give them basic immortality as long as its protection is guaranteed.<br>
    
        These guardians pair or squad up to form "fireteams" together, and they embark on missions to safeguard each race from
        the looming threats of the universe such as actors who use greed or opportunity to create chaos in the community, planets
        which remain too unstable for humanity to reside in, a robotoic megalomaniac who has lived for hundreds of years through 
        tech-infused obessions, or even gods of darkness who seek to destroy the civilizations each time they see a chance to do so
